# Warframe drops program

This is just a small fan project for Warframe video game that uses data provided by https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-drop-data. It's not a serious project but more of a project to learn through.
Data is not included due to its size, but can downloaded through the site of https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-drop-data and put into the data folder with name 'all.json'. Intention is to include a way to download the data through the program.
